# A game which is played inside it's own QR code

## Play it [HERE](https://qrgame.artomweb.com)

The idea is that eventually the game will add a random string to the end of the url that links to that specific game. The qr code will be generated and goal will be placed at the end of the longest path.

Could the qr code disappear when you start moving the player. Requiring the player to memorise the route and complete it within the fastest amount of time?
